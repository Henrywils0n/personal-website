# Intro

I am a newly graduated engineer from Queen's University in Ontario, Canada. I recieved my BASc in Applied Mathematics and Engineering with a specialization in computations and communications. This website holds my (slow) programming journey.<br><br>

I have no cool story about how I have been programming since I was a child. In fact, I wrote my first line of code when in the course  `Introdution to Computer Programming` in the summer before the second year of my Bachelors. Since then, I have grown to love programming and mathematics. <br><br>

I especially enjoy projects related to data AI. This allows me to put to use some of my (what some people would call useless) math knowledge. Check out some of [my projects](../projects) in the projects page if you aren't as concerned with these personal details.<br><br>

This page is a work in progress and I will continue to add, but below, you will find a number of fun facts and activities that will tell you a little more about me :).
