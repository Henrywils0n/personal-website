# Intro

I am a newly graduated engineer from Queen's University in Ontario, Canada. I recieved my BASc in Applied Mathematics and Engineering with a specialization in computations and communications. This website encapsulates my (slow) journey to becoming a programmer.

I have no cool story about how I have been programming since I was a child. In fact, I wrote my first line of code when in the course  `Introdution to Computer Programming` in the summer before the second year of my Bachelors. Since then, I have struck a balance in programming and mathematics. I must admit that web development is not my favourite part of development, but as my degree may suggest, I do like solving problems, and what better way to do that then computers?

I especially enjoy projects related to AI. This allows me to put to use some of my (what some people would call useless) math knowledge. check out some of my projects in the projects page if you aren't as concerned with these personal details.

This page is a work in progress and I will continue to add, but below, you will find a number of fun facts and activities that will tell you a little more about me :).
