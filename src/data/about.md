# Intro

I am a newly graduated engineer from Queen's University in Ontario, Canada. I recieved my BASc in Applied Mathematics and Engineering with a specialization in computations and communications. This website encapsulates my (slow) journey to becoming a programmer.

I have no cool story about how I have been programming since I was a child. In fact, I wrote my first line of code when in the course  `Introdution to Computer Programming` in the summer before the second year of my Bachelors. Since then, I have struck a balance in programming and mathematics. I must admit that web development is not my favourite part of development, but as my degree may suggest, I do like solving problems, and what better way to do that then computers?

Below, you will find a number of fun facts and activities that will tell you a little more about me :).
